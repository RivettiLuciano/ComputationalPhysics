# Computational Physics

This is a set of physical simulations done in C.

#1-Molecular Dynamics.

It has a simulation of a gas of N particles interacting by a lenard-jhonson potential. I used the Verlet algorithm to find the position, velocity and aceleration of each particle. 


The code allows to recreate the position of each particle time by time ploting a gif It also show how to Loschmid paradox and the Maxwell Boltzman distribution of velocities. www
