# Computational Physics

This is a set of physical simulations done in C.

# 1- Molecular Dynamics.

It has a simulation of N particles trapped inside a box of volume V, interacting by a Lennard-Jones potential. I used the Verlet algorithm to find the position, velocity and aceleration of each particle. The code allows to recreate the position of each particle time by time ploting a gif. It also show the Loschmidt paradox and the Maxwell Boltzman distribution of velocities.

# 2- Quantum wave packet.

It has a simulation of the interaction of a quantum wave packet with different potentials. The code is ready to be run with a Single wall potential, double well potential and without potential.
